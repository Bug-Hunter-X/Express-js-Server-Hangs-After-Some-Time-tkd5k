# Express.js Server Hanging Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js Express.js applications where the server may hang or become unresponsive after a period of time.  This can be caused by various factors, including unhandled exceptions, memory leaks, or blocking operations.

## Problem

The `server.js` file contains a simple Express.js server. However, under sustained load or after a certain duration, this server can stop responding to requests.  The issue is likely caused by improper error handling or a resource leak.

## Solution

The `serverSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the server that addresses the potential issues. It incorporates better error handling and prevents resource leaks.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `node server.js`
5. Send multiple requests to the server; observe the response time
6. Run `node serverSolution.js`
7. Send multiple requests to the server and observe the difference in response time.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling and resource management in Node.js applications.
